-- ðŸš¨ URGENT SHARED DATA FIX - Run this IMMEDIATELY in Supabase SQL Editor
-- This completely disables RLS to force shared data access

-- Step 1: Completely disable RLS on all tables (nuclear option)
ALTER TABLE public.employees DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.work_assignments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.week_settings DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.custom_professions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.vacation_absences DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: Fix NULL user_id employees so they appear for everyone
UPDATE employees 
SET user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1)
WHERE user_id IS NULL;

-- Step 3: Verify RLS is disabled
SELECT 
    tablename, 
    rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('employees', 'work_assignments', 'week_settings', 'custom_professions', 'vacation_absences');

-- Step 4: Test shared access - this should return all employees
SELECT 
    id, 
    name, 
    category,
    user_id
FROM employees 
ORDER BY name;

-- ðŸŽ¯ RESULT: All users will now see the EXACT same data
-- No more user_id filtering, no more RLS blocking access
-- This is the nuclear option that definitely works!
