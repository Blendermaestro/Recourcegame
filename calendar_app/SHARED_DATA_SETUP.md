# Shared Data Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your calendar app now supports **shared data across all users**! Here's what was changed:

### 📱 App Changes Made:
- ✅ Created `SharedDataService` for cloud storage
- ✅ Updated `EmployeeSettingsView` to use shared database
- ✅ Added reset button with password `4891` to clear all data
- ✅ Fixed employee list sync between settings and calendar
- ✅ All compilation errors resolved

### 📋 Features:
- **✅ Shared Employees**: All users see the same employee list
- **✅ Shared Calendar**: All work assignments are shared
- **✅ Real-time Sync**: Changes appear immediately for all users
- **✅ Reset Function**: Password `4891` clears all shared data
- **✅ Fallback**: Falls back to local storage if database fails

## 🚀 How to Enable Shared Access

### Step 1: Update Database Policies
Run this SQL script in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the content from shared_policies.sql file
```

**OR** Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Run the `shared_policies.sql` script

### Step 2: Test the App
1. **Build and run** the app: `flutter run`
2. **Add an employee** in Employee Settings
3. **Check from another device/user** - they should see the same employee
4. **Add calendar assignments** - all users should see the same data

### Step 3: Reset Data (If Needed)
- In Employee Settings, tap the **🗑️ Reset button**
- Enter password: `4891`
- This clears ALL data for ALL users

## 🔧 How It Works

### Before (Local Storage):
- Each user had their own employee list
- No data sharing between devices
- Used SharedPreferences

### After (Shared Cloud Storage):
- All users share the same database
- Real-time synchronization
- Uses Supabase cloud storage
- Fallback to local storage if offline

### Data Flow:
```
User A adds employee → Supabase Database ← User B sees employee
User B assigns shifts → Shared Calendar ← User A sees assignments
```

## 🎯 Benefits

- **✅ Cross-device sync**: Same data on all devices
- **✅ Team collaboration**: Multiple users can manage the same calendar
- **✅ Real-time updates**: Changes appear immediately
- **✅ Centralized management**: One source of truth for all data
- **✅ Backup safety**: Data stored in cloud, not locally

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If employees don't sync:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Supabase credentials
3. Check database policies are applied
4. Use reset function to clear old local data

### If reset doesn't work:
1. Verify password is exactly: `4891`
2. Check Supabase dashboard for data deletion
3. Restart the app

### If compilation errors:
1. Run: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
2. Check all imports are correct
3. Verify Supabase packages are installed
